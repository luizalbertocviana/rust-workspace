  - (G = (V, E), D, l, u)
  - w : E -> R? min violated constraints? min num components?
  - w choosen from [0, 50]:
    - uniformly distributed
    - P% in [15, 35] and (100 - p)% in [0, 14] \cup [36, 50]
    - P \in {60, 80}
  - G parameters: number of vertices, density (0.25, 0.50, 0.75)
  - D structures: arborescence, arbitrary dag, k-distant dependencies
  - for each parameter combination, generate at least five instances
  - l, u: (0, 0), ({0, 1}, {0, 1}), ({0, 1}, < dep), (< dep, = dep)
  - l, u: (= dep, = dep), as long as it is not hard to generate
